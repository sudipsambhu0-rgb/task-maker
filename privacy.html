  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our task management website.

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Our website is designed to work without collecting any personal information such as your name, email address,
    phone number, or location.

    <li>Selected work category (coding, study, workout, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
  <p>
    All data created on this website is stored locally in your browser using <strong>localStorage</strong>.

    <li>Your data never leaves your device</li>
    <li>We do not have access to your data</li>
    <li>No data is sent to any server or database</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you clear your browser data or uninstall your browser, your tasks may be deleted automatically.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    This website itself does not use cookies to track users.
    However, third-party services such as Google AdSense may use cookies or similar technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    These cookies help display ads that are relevant to users and improve advertising performance.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Google AdSense</h2>
  <p>
    We may display advertisements provided by Google AdSense.
    Google uses the DoubleClick cookie to show ads to users based on their visit to this and other websites.

  <p>
    Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Google’s Ads Settings.
  </p>

  <h2>5. How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Display your tasks on the website</li>
    <li>Mark tasks as completed or incomplete</li>
    <li>Improve your productivity experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to protect your data.
